# Installing dcdis

For most machines and configurations, the following is all you need.

	cd src
	./configure
	make
	make install


**dcdis** will be installed in `/usr/local/bin` by default, but this can be
altered by specifying another location to `configure` using this formula:


	./configure --prefix=/installation/directory


For more information, please consult the [README.md](README.md) file.
