# Installing dcdis

For most machines and configurations, the following is all you need.


	./configure
	make
	make install


**dcdis** will be installed in `/usr/local/bin` by default, but this can be altered
by specifying another location to configure using this formula:


	./configure --prefix=/installation/directory
